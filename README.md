Maven Restaurant Investment Analysis Challenge
Project Overview
This project, part of the Maven Restaurant Challenge, involves a detailed analysis of a fictional dataset provided by Maven Analytics. As the Lead Analyst for a firm investing in new restaurant opportunities abroad, the goal is to study the restaurant market in several Mexican cities. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns and trends to understand the market dynamics and to aid in making informed investment decisions.

Challenge Objective
Task: Analyze the restaurant market in Mexican cities using a provided dataset.
Goal: Create a single-page visual or dashboard highlighting key factors for restaurant investment and support it with data-driven insights.

Dataset Description
The dataset is a fictional representation provided by Maven Analytics, simulating restaurant ratings in Mexico by real consumers from the year 2012. It includes:
restaurants.csv: Data on individual restaurants, their locations, and types.
ratings.csv: Consumer ratings for each restaurant.
consumer_preferences.csv: Consumer cuisine preferences.
restaurant_cuisines.csv: Types of cuisines offered by restaurants.

Analysis Approach
The project involves a series of SQL queries aiming to:
Assess restaurant density across cities.
Evaluate cuisine diversity and its market saturation.
Identify top-rated cuisines and consumer preferences.
Focus on non-Mexican cuisines with significant potential for investment.

Key Findings
San Luis Potosi: High restaurant density suggests market saturation.
Jiutepec: Fewer restaurants indicate potential for new ventures.
Cuisine Trends: Non-Mexican cuisines like Family, International, Japanese, Brewery, and Contemporary show promise due to lower saturation and high ratings.
How to Use
The SQL scripts are annotated and can be executed in any MySQL-compatible environment. They are designed to provide insights into the dataset and can be adapted for similar market analysis scenarios.

Future Work
Conduct a deeper demographic analysis for targeted restaurant offerings.

About the Data
The dataset is a fictional creation by Maven Analytics for the purpose of this challenge. It is designed to simulate real-world data analysis scenarios in the restaurant industry.
